## Research Experience  
### Northeastern University (Advisor: Qing Zhou)  
**Role**: Research Assistant | **Duration**: Jul. 2024 – Present  
**Focus Area**: Balanced Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering Problem (under the project "Research on Resource Scheduling in Cloud Data Centers for Complex Tasks")  

**Key Contributions**:  
1. Implemented the core clustering algorithm using **Java**;  
2. Secured optimal initial solutions by repeatedly running the K-means algorithm, and developed a fast evaluation technique to gauge exchange costs—utilized the tabu search algorithm to optimize one-move and swap-move operations, improving solution quality;  
3. Integrated the population algorithm to prevent the model from getting stuck in local optima: enabled information sharing among "search individuals" to explore multiple paths, and provided direction for algorithm evolution when encountering local optima, enhancing exploration ability and overall solution quality.  


## Internship Experience  
### 1. Midea Group (Shanghai) | Algorithm Intern (Human-Computer Interaction)   Midea_Midea Group_Professional Platform_AI Research Institute_AI Algorithms_Human-Computer Interaction
**Duration**: Jul. 2025 – Present | **Tech Stack**: Python, Streamlit, Mem0, Multi-Agent Systems, Prompt Engineering  
**Responsibilities & Achievements**:  
- Developed a Master Agent system using the Streamlit framework to coordinate multiple sub-agents (data analysis/device control);  
- Implemented a Mem0-based dynamic memory module to support long-context conversation persistence;  
- Designed and optimized prompt templates for memory extraction/update and response generation, improving context coherence in 80+ user test scenarios;  
- Built an interactive demo to showcase real-time agent decision logic and task decomposition processes.  


### 2. Migu Music Co., Ltd. | Data Algorithm Intern  
**Duration**: Dec. 2024 – Mar. 2025 | **Tech Stack**: Python, StableDiffusion, Prompt Engineering  
**Responsibilities & Achievements**:  
- Developed and optimized prompts for large language models, text-to-image, and text-to-video models;  
- Used StableDiffusion for image generation to assist in building Spring Festival-themed agents;  
- Conducted structured label recognition for audio, video, and image information, and was responsible for data construction.  


### 3. Shenzhen Bairen Biotechnology Co., Ltd. | Platform Development Intern  
**Duration**: Oct. 2024 – Dec. 2024 | **Tech Stack**: Python, Docker, Linux  
**Responsibilities & Achievements**:  
- Wrote automated scripts in Python to optimize data processing and analysis processes;  
- Used Docker container technology to build, deploy, and manage application environments;  
- Completed server management, file system operations, problem debugging, and high-performance computing tasks in the Linux environment;  
- Wrote gpt4o-based prompts focused on bioinformatics to extract key information from source code or manuscripts and output it in JSON format.  


### 4. Chengdu Xiaoduo Technology Co., Ltd. | R&D Intern (Prompt Engineer)  Digital Experience Innovation Team
**Duration**: Jul. 2024 – Sep. 2024 | **Tech Stack**: Python, Elasticsearch, Streamlit, RAG Framework  
**Responsibilities & Achievements**:  
- Built a routing-style intelligent Agent based on the RAG framework: used large language models to rewrite and classify user queries, and routed them to four workflows (knowledge base Q&A, product Q&A, product recommendation, product comparison);  
- Established a vectorized database with Elasticsearch, completing lightweight vectorization storage of knowledge base content through manually defined semantic features (e.g., product keyword weights, question intent tags);  
- Designed interactive visualizations and interfaces using Streamlit to create simple demos for showcasing the integration of retrieval augmentation technology in AI interactions.
