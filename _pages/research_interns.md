## Research Experience  
### Northeastern University (Advisor: Qing Zhou)  
**Role**: Research Assistant | **Duration**: Jul. 2024 â€“ Present  
**Focus Area**: Balanced Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering Problem (under the project "Research on Resource Scheduling in Cloud Data Centers for Complex Tasks")  

**Key Contributions**:  
1. Implemented the core clustering algorithm using **Java**;  
2. Secured optimal initial solutions by repeatedly running the K-means algorithm, and developed a fast evaluation technique to gauge exchange costsâ€”utilized the tabu search algorithm to optimize one-move and swap-move operations, improving solution quality;  
3. Integrated the population algorithm to prevent the model from getting stuck in local optima: enabled information sharing among "search individuals" to explore multiple paths, and provided direction for algorithm evolution when encountering local optima, enhancing exploration ability and overall solution qualityðŸ”¶1-20ðŸ”¶,ðŸ”¶1-21ðŸ”¶,.
