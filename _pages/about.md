## About Me  
I am an undergraduate student majoring in Information Management & Information Systems at Northeastern University (Sep. 2022 – Jul. 2026, Expected Graduation) with a cumulative GPA of 3.4976/5 (85/100). I have hands-on experience in national research projects (NSFC Youth Fund), 6 industry internships (including Fortune Global 500 Midea Group), and independent technical initiatives, focusing on translating expertise in generative AI, algorithm optimization, and data engineering into scalable, practical solutions.


## Core Research Focus  
My academic and technical focus centers on:  
- **Generative AI & LLM Applications**: Prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-turn chat agents, memory systems (Mem0), and LoRA-based model fine-tuning (Qwen 8B);
- **Intelligent Algorithm Optimization**: Balanced minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC), tabu search integration, population diversification mechanisms, and K-means improvement;
- **Data Science & Engineering**: End-to-end modeling pipelines, hybrid retrieval (BM25 + HNSW), data preprocessing, and large-scale dataset curation;
- **Practical Application**: Applying technologies to smart home AI, customer service RAG systems, bioinformatics pipeline automation, and financial product subscription prediction.


## Key Skills  
### Technical Skills  
- **Data Analysis & Machine Learning**: Proficient in Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, LightGBM/XGBoost) for feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation; skilled in R for statistical analysis;
- **Generative AI & Agents**: Expertise in prompt orchestration, RAG pipeline development, LLM safety assessment, Stable Diffusion (text-to-image/video), and multi-agent memory architecture;
- **Programming & Development**: Java (algorithm implementation, OOP), Python (automation, agent development, Streamlit demos), SQL (data querying & optimization);
- **Database & Infrastructure**: MySQL (relational databases), Elasticsearch (hybrid retrieval), Redis (vector store, chat history management); Git, Docker, Linux, Jupyter Notebook;
- **Full-Stack & Visualization**: Backend (Flask, SQLAlchemy), Frontend (Angular), Tableau for data visualization, and performance tuning for concurrent systems.
