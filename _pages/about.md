## About Me  
I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Information Management & Information Systems** at Northeastern University (Sep.2022 – Jul.2026) with a GPA of 3.4686/5. My academic and professional focus lies in **data mining, prompt engineering, multi-agent systems, and intelligent algorithm optimization**—backed by hands-on experience in national-level research projects, 4 industry internships, and independent data science projects.  

I have also enriched my global perspective through international programs: I earned a 4.5/4.5 GPA at Hanyang University International Summer School (2025) and a 4.25/4.5 GPA at its Winter School (2024-2025), and was awarded a full scholarship for the Estonian National Summer School (2025, selected from 500+ applicants).


## Key Highlights  
- **Research Experience**: Served as a Research Assistant in the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Fund Project, implementing balanced minimum sum-of-squares clustering algorithms in Java (optimized via tabu search and population algorithms to avoid local optima).  
- **Industry Internships**: Gained practical experience across AI R&D (Chengdu Xiaoduo Tech), bioinformatics (Shenzhen Bairen Biotech), data algorithms (Migu Music), and human-computer interaction (Midea Group), with expertise in Python, Elasticsearch, Streamlit, Mem0, and StableDiffusion.  
- **Data Science Project**: Led an independent project on "Bank Customer Product Subscription Prediction," using Pandas, scikit-learn, and LightGBM to achieve 89% prediction accuracy, supporting targeted marketing strategies.  
- **Academic Achievements**: Won the **National First Prize** in the Business Elite Challenge Accounting and Business Case Competition (2024), and was named "Outstanding Camper" at Northeastern University’s Overseas Economic Management Scholars Seminar (2024).
